# 🃏 Slay the Spire – Simplified Combat Engine

A minimalist, combat-focused adaptation of *Slay the Spire*, implemented in Java. This project distills the core mechanics of the original game into a streamlined, turn-based battle system, omitting complexities like relics, map navigation, and events.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to replicate the fundamental combat experience of *Slay the Spire*, focusing on:

- **Turn-Based Combat**: Player and enemy alternate turns, executing actions based on drawn cards.
- **Card Mechanics**: A limited set of cards (e.g., Attack, Defend, Bash) with predefined effects.
- **Status Effects**: Basic buffs and debuffs such as Strength and Vulnerable.
- **Simplified Gameplay**: Excludes relics, multiple enemies, and map progression to concentrate on combat logic.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented

- **Card System**: 
  - Defined card classes with attributes like name, cost, and effect.
  - Basic deck management with draw and discard mechanics.

- **Combat Engine**: 
  - Turn management between player and enemy.
  - Health and block calculations.
  - Application of status effects with duration tracking.

- **Status Effects**: 
  - Implementation of Strength (increases damage) and Vulnerable (increases damage taken).
